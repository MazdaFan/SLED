The Smart LED Animator

SLED is a piece of software for creating animation for Smart LEDs (RGB Pixels).  It can be used to quickly create
animations for Horizontal (LEDTrix), Vertical (MegaTrees), Circular (Arches), and Radial (Spinners) orientations.
It will export the animations in Light-O-Rama S3,  Vixen, and LightShow Pro formats to be incorporated into your shows.

It has been created with Delphi 2009 RAD Pascal and is licenced under GPL V2.
